WIP - C++ version of OCaml-C bindings generator using libclang

binaryninjacore.h is a test file for the generator, and is my main
use-case at the moment.


Issues:

libclang doesn't seem to expose types for function pointers in
structs: the returned type is CXType_Unexposed. However, we can still
print the function prototype type as a string.

Potential way to do fix here:
