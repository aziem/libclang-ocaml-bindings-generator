C++ version of OCaml-C bindings generator using libclang

binaryninjacore.h is a test file for the generator, and is my main
use-case at the moment.

Usage:

./generator -f <filename>

Optional -c++ argument makes libclang parse the file as a C++ file,
not a C file.

The output can be redirected to a file, and is two OCaml modules: one
for enums/structs bindings and the other for function bindings.
