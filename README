C++ version of OCaml-C bindings generator using libclang

Usage:

./generator -f <c/c++ header file>

Optional -c++ argument makes libclang parse the file as a C++ header,
not a C header.

The output can be redirected to a file, and is two OCaml modules: one
for enums/structs bindings and the other for function bindings.
