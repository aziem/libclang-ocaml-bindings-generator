Notes:

libclang doesn't seem to expose types for function pointers in
structs: the returned type is CXType_Unexposed. However, we can still
print the function prototype type as a string.

Solution from here:

http://clang-developers.42468.n3.nabble.com/Function-pointer-in-a-struct-declaration-td4044706.html

is to get the canonical type of the unexposed type and then that
exposes the function proto type giving us enough info to translate to
an ocaml function signature.
